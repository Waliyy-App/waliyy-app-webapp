      <div className="flex flex-col gap-8 text-lg mb-10">
        <p>
          WaliyyApp is aimed at eligible Muslim bachelors and ladies who are
          ready for marriage. As part of Islam, the mahaarim plays an important
          role in the marriage process and this is why they also have a vital
          role on our app. You are here because you are looking for a wife for
          yourself or a husband for your female relative. (Mahram/Mahaarim:
          father and brothers of a Muslim lady or her paternal grandfather or
          uncles).
        </p>
        <p>
          We are striving to carry out our duties and responsibilities as
          parents to help our singles find good Muslim spouses and contribute to
          reducing the fitna of Zina and divorce in our communities. For too
          long, we have left our youths to find spouses by themselves without
          any assistance from parents and this has created so many problems for
          our children and the society.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are here because you are searching for a spouse for yourself or
          you have young people who are ready to marry and you are actively
          seeking suitable Muslim singles. We wish to support you to achieve
          this objective in line with the dictates of the Qurâ€™an and Sunnah.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to do this, members need to familiarise themselves with
          simple group rules and follow them as diligently as possible. This is
          a learning process for us all and the group admins are open to
          suggestions for improvement to better improve the process and outcomes
          in shaa Allah. However, we shall not hesitate to evict anyone
          violating the rules, particularly after warning.
